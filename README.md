# Infectious Diseases Simulation
This project will simulate the transmission of a simple contagion through a population.

## Modes
### Forward Simulation
Can be random or deterministic.
In random mode, interactions within the population will be random. 
In deterministic mode, interactions within the population are set and carried out. 

### Backward Simulation

User defines end state, as well as interactions, program returns patient zero.

## Progress
Backward simulation mode is top priority, after will come Forward simulation mode.
